# Klayr Explorer

Klayr Explorer is a basic blockchain explorer for the Klayr ecosystem, designed to help users navigate and explore the Klayr blockchain. This project is currently a work in progress as we work towards our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The final version of Klayr Explorer will serve as the foundation for the future Klayr platform.
